## Sea Surface Temperature (by GCOM-C)

Sea surface temperature (SST) observed by the Global Change Observation Mission - Climate "SHIKISAI" (GCOM-C). It is characterized by its ability to observe coastal areas with a spatial resolution of approximately 250m. When there are clouds, observations are not possible and data is missing. JAXA Earth API publishes global data with a spatial resolution of approximately 250m. Daytime data was observed around 10:30am local time in each area, and nighttime data was observed around 10:30pm local time in each area.

## Sea Surface Temperature (by GCOM-W)

Sea surface temperature (SST) observed by the Global Change Observation Mission - Water "SHIZUKU" (GCOM-W). It can be observed even when there are clouds. The spatial resolution is lower than that of GCOM-C, and data is missing near the coast because it cannot observe. Daytime data was observed around 1:30pm local time in each area, and nighttime data was observed around 1:30am local time in each area. This data uses a 5-day moving average to reduce missing values due to outside the observation range, etc.

- title: Forest Non Forest map
- description: The global 25-meter resolution PALSAR-2 Forest/Non-forest map (FNF) is based on data acquired by the L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR-2) onboard the Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2). The PALSAR-2 Forest/Non-forest map (FNF) is a data set that shows the global forest distribution. The L-band SAR backscatter coefficient is sensitive to vegetation, especially in forests. Large values indicate forested areas, while small values indicate non-forested areas and water bodies. The Earth Observation Research Center of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) has been working to create a global forest distribution map by classifying images based on these characteristics. The purpose of this dataset is to make the results available to the public and to use them to understand forest distribution and its time-series changes.
